									<h1>Overview</h1>
									<p>IBM Certified Data Analyst with 2+ years of experience and a proven track record in delivering automated story-driven reports,
										competent in analyzing the statistical data, & recording appropriate market behavior over a defined period of time to generate valuable
										insights using collected data for strategizing and forecasting future business plans.</p>
								</header>
								<p>To give you a little background about myself, I come from a town called Katni, which is in MP. 
									I graduated from NMIMS, completing a bachelor's in technology degree in computers in 2020. 
									As a result of my passion for Data Analytics and Science, I left most of the companies from 
									campus placement, since they were not offering core analytics positions. We had only a couple 
									of them but could not get through. Thereafter, I started applying off-campus and landed a job 
									as a Data Analyst at an AI-based startup whose MSP was to give insights in the written English 
									language and a few charts to support the narrative.
								</p>

								<p>My roles and responsibilities at the previous company included information gathering from the 
									client, creating wireframes/sample reports, writing ETL scripts in python, creating the 
									automated report and incorporating feedback, and maintaining the project. I have worked in 
									various domains such as BFSI, Pharma, FMCG, Media & TV. I had an opportunity to work with the 
									clients directly, taking their feedback and giving them suggestions on the topic at hand. I have 
									gained confidence and learned how to communicate technical things to the non-tech crowd.
								</p>

								<p>I am looking forward to working with a company where I could take my Data Science career to the
									next level. I have mastered descriptive and diagnostic analysis and want to excel in predictive analysis
									as well.
								</p>

								<p>Music has been constant in my journey. I am a guitarist and mostly listen to Metal.
									I also like to write as to improve on my writing skills. Please have a look at the movierdo
									link below and also to my medium page where I post about technical stuff. Do let me know if you like it.

									<p>While working on some of the projects, I cam across some topics which I thought had very 
										few resourses online and hence my effort to best describe the problem and give the best solution
										I could think of. Please let me know if you have some suggestions on how I can imporove these.</p>
